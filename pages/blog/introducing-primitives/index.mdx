As design systems grow in popularity, so does accessibility concerns. Unfortunately, most teams don't have the time nor the capacity to address the requirements of complex components.

This is why we've built Primitives. A comprehensive library of accessible and customizable components. Every design system shipped with Modulz will be using Primitives as a foundation.

Our own design system, [Radix](https://radix.modulz.app), is already built on top of Primitives and the Modulz UI is built with Radix. Some call it dogfooding.

In this series, we'll showcase some of our Primitives and their functionalities.
