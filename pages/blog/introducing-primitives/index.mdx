As design systems grow in popularity, so does accessibility concerns. Unfortunately, most teams don't have the time or capacity to address the requirements of complex components.

This is why we've built Primitives. A comprehensive library of accessible and customizable components. Every design system shipped with Modulz will be using Primitives as a foundation.

Our own design system, [Radix](https://radix.modulz.app), is already built on top of Primitives and the Modulz UI is built with Radix. Some call it dogfooding.

Let's take a closer look at some of our Primitives below.

## Tooltip

The complexities of an accessible Tooltip can be easily overlooked. CSS only Tooltips are cool, but chances are, they'll lack some key accessibility features.

Tooltips are a core component for us since it's used often within the Modulz interface, so it had to be excellent.

Tooltips should appear as a result of hovering or focusing an element, but only after a small delay. If a tooltip is already visible, hovering or focusing another element that also displays a tooltip, should display it instantly.

The tooltip should disappear when the element is no longer being hovered or focused, when pressing the `Escape` key or when the user has interacted with the element, for example, a click on a button.

Tooltips are customizable, so if you wanted it to display to the right of the element, you'd use the `side` prop. If you wanted it to be centered against the element, you'd use the `align` prop. If you wanted to hide the arrow, you'd use the `noArrow` prop.

In addition to all of the above, tooltips are aware of collisions. If a tooltip doesn't fit where it's supposed to, it'll automatically be adjusted to ensure it's visible for the users.
