Building an accessible custom Select component from scratch is undoubtedly one of the most challenging pieces of UI one can tackle.

There are many cases that need to be handled, such as keyboard navigation, collision-aware positioning and accessibility concerns.

Because of the amount of time it takes to make it right, teams tend to take shortcuts. As a result either the end user suffers (lack of functionality) or the product (lack of design).

In this article, we'll look at how some of the biggest websites in the world have implemented their Select component, and how we went back to the drawing board to build our Select Primitive with accessibility features out of the box and customisable to your product's need.

## Selects in the wild

For each of the following example, we'll be looking at how they've implemented these features:

- Keyboard navigation
- Voiceover
- Typeahead
- Focus management
- Dynamic positioning

## Select Primitive

### Keyboard navigation

We support full keyboard accessibility so you can do anything you need without using your mouse.

When the Select Button is focused, you can:

- Press `space` key to open the menu
- Press `up` and `down` arrow keys to open the menu
- Typeahead lookups

When the Select Menu is opened, you can:

- Press `space` or `enter` keys to select the highlighted item
- Press `esc` to close the menu
- Press `up` and `down` arrow keys to navigate across items
- Typeahead lookups

### Typeahead

You can rely on typeahead funtionality if you're focused on the Select Button or when the Select Menu is opened.

<ProductVideo small src={typeaheadClosed} />
<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ textAlign: 'center', color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>

</Text>

<ProductVideo small src={typeaheadOpen} />
<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ textAlign: 'center', color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>
  Typeahead when Select Menu is opened example
</Text>

Pressing the same letter will loop over all items that start with that letter.

<ProductVideo small src={typeaheadLoop} />
<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ textAlign: 'center', color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>
  Typeahead looping example
</Text>

Loop through items starting with the same letter if that letter is pressed repeatedly

### Positioning

When you open the menu, we'll make sure that it's properly positioned above the menu, whilst keeping the selected item placed on top.

### Colision

In the unlikely scenario where there's not enough space to position the menu relatively to the selected item, we'll adjust the positioning automatically.

### Scrolling

If the menu needs scrolling, we'll automatically add Scroll Indicators where necessary. As you start scrolling the menu, we'll proportionally update the height to allow more items to be visible at once.

### Styling

As showed in the demo above, all the parts (and their corresponding states) that make up a Select componment are available in the parts panel.

The Select Primitve consists of two main parts, these are the `Button` and the `Menu`. Each of these part contains furhter nested parts.

<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ textAlign: 'center', color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>
