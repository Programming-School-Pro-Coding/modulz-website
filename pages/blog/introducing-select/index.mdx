Building an accessible custom Select component from scratch is undoubtedly one of the most challenging pieces of UI one can tackle.

There are many cases that need to be handled, such as keyboard navigation, typeahead functionality, collision-aware positioning and many accessibility concerns.

Due of the amount of time it takes to make it right, teams tend to take shortcuts. As a result either the end user suffers (lack of functionality) or the product (lack of design).

In this article, we'll look at how some of the biggest websites in the world have implemented their Select component, and how we went back to the drawing board to build our Select Primitive with accessibility features out of the box and customisable to your product's need.

## Selects in the wild

We've compiled a list of examples of how Select components are typically implemented. After having gone through hundreds of websites, it's safe to say that it boils down to two common implementations, both with compromises.

### Compromise on design

The first approach is to rely on the native Select.

This is typically done by making the `select` element transparent and positioned on top of a `button`. This is the element that gets styled. When the user clicks on that `button`, they are actually clicking on the transparent `select`. Finally, when the `select` opens, the transparency is removed.

The good thing with this approach is that you get all of the accessibility features and complex UI logic handled for you automatically.

The downside is that styling is extremely limited, as a result users will see a native-looking menu popping up on beautifully designed products.

<Grid sx={{
		gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr',
		gap: 1,
		bg: 'gray300',
		border: t => `1px solid ${t.colors.gray300}`,
		borderRadius: 3,
		overflow: 'hidden',
		mx: [-5, -5, -9]
	}}
>

<Image sx={{ width: '100%', margin: 0 }} m={0} src={apple} />
<Image sx={{ width: '100%', margin: 0 }} m={0} src={instagram} />
<Image sx={{ width: '100%', margin: 0 }} m={0} src={netflix} />
<Image sx={{ width: '100%', margin: 0 }} m={0} src={tesla} />

</Grid>

### Compromise on accessibility

The second approach is to prioritise aesthetics over accessibility.

## Select Primitive

### Keyboard navigation

We support full keyboard accessibility so you can do anything you need without using your mouse.

When the Select Button is focused, you can:

- Press `space` key to open the menu
- Press `up` and `down` arrow keys to open the menu
- Typeahead lookups

When the Select Menu is opened, you can:

- Press `space` or `enter` keys to select the highlighted item
- Press `esc` to close the menu
- Press `up` and `down` arrow keys to navigate across items
- Typeahead lookups

### Typeahead

You can rely on typeahead funtionality if you're focused on the Select Button or when the Select Menu is opened.

<ProductVideo small src={typeaheadClosed} />
<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ textAlign: 'center', color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>
  Typeahead when Select button is focused example
</Text>

<ProductVideo small src={typeaheadOpen} />
<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ textAlign: 'center', color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>
  Typeahead when Select Menu is opened example
</Text>

Pressing the same letter will loop over all items that start with that letter.

<ProductVideo small src={typeaheadLoop} />
<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ textAlign: 'center', color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>
  Typeahead looping example
</Text>

Loop through items starting with the same letter if that letter is pressed repeatedly

### Screen reader

We provide the right `aria-*` attributes according to the WAI-ARIA specification to ensure voice over works correctly.

### Positioning

When you open the menu, we'll make sure that it's properly positioned above the menu, whilst keeping the selected item placed on top.

### Collision

In the unlikely scenario where there's not enough space to position the menu relatively to the selected item, we'll adjust the positioning automatically.

### Scroll based height

If the menu needs scrolling, we'll automatically add Scroll Indicators where necessary. As you start scrolling the menu, we'll proportionally update the height to allow more items to be visible at once.

### Focus trap

When the Menu is opened, the focus is trapped to the Menu container. Pressing `tab` at this point will prevent the focused element to changing. To navigate across the Items, the up and down arrow must be used.

### Scroll lock

When the Menu is opened, the page cannot be scrolled.

### Block clicks outside

When the Menu is opened, clicks on elements outside of it will be blocked. When you click outside, the Menu will be closed.

### Styling

As showed in the demo above, all the parts (and their corresponding states) that make up a Select componment are available in the parts panel.

The Select Primitve consists of two main parts, these are the `Button` and the `Menu`. Each of these part contains furhter nested parts.

<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ textAlign: 'center', color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>
