<Intro>

Building an accessible custom Select component from scratch is one of the most challenging pieces of UI one can tackle.

There are many cases that need to be handled varying from accessibility concerns to collision-aware positioning.

It can take months of work to build it correctly. And because of that most teams are unable to implement or the required features.

In this article, I'll highlight the most common pitfalls of custom built Selects and how we went back to the drawing board to build ours.

</Intro>

<Divider mt={8} />

## Common pitfalls

The majority of custom built Selects lack keyboard navigation, typeahead functionality, collision-aware positioning and screen reader support.

<Grid
mx={[0, -5, -9]}
sx={{
	gridTemplateColumns: ['1fr', '1fr 1fr'],
	gridColumnGap: [0, 4, 5]
}}>

<Box>

<ProductVideo
  small
  src={yelp}
  mb={2}
  sx={{
    transition: 'ease-out 200ms',
    transformOrigin: '50% 85%',
    ':hover': {
      transitionDuration: '250ms',
      transitionDelay: '100ms',
      transform: [null, 'scale(1.25)'],
      boxShadow: [null, 'rgba(22, 23, 24, 0.35) 0px 10px 38px -10px, rgba(22, 23, 24, 0.2) 0px 10px 20px -15px'],
    },
  }}
/>

In this example, pressing <Code variant="fade">Up</Code> and <Code variant="fade">Down</Code> arrows don't
correctly cycle over the items.

</Box>

<Box>

<ProductVideo
  small
  src={facebook}
  mb={2}
  sx={{
    transition: 'ease-out 200ms',
    transformOrigin: '50% 85%',
    ':hover': {
      transitionDuration: '250ms',
      transitionDelay: '100ms',
      transform: [null, 'scale(1.25)'],
      boxShadow: [null, 'rgba(22, 23, 24, 0.35) 0px 10px 38px -10px, rgba(22, 23, 24, 0.2) 0px 10px 20px -15px'],
    },
  }}
/>

In this example, typing in "US Dollar" doesn't automatically jump to that option.

</Box>

<Box>

<ProductVideo
  small
  src={soundcloud}
  mb={2}
  sx={{
    transition: 'ease-out 200ms',
    transformOrigin: '50% 85%',
    ':hover': {
      transitionDuration: '250ms',
      transitionDelay: '100ms',
      transform: [null, 'scale(1.25)'],
      boxShadow: [null, 'rgba(22, 23, 24, 0.35) 0px 10px 38px -10px, rgba(22, 23, 24, 0.2) 0px 10px 20px -15px'],
    },
  }}
/>

In this example, part of the Menu is hidden below the fold.

</Box>

<Box>

<ProductVideo
  small
  src={squarespace}
  mb={2}
  sx={{
    transition: 'ease-out 200ms',
    transformOrigin: '50% 85%',
    ':hover': {
      transitionDuration: '250ms',
      transitionDelay: '100ms',
      transform: [null, 'scale(1.25)'],
      boxShadow: [null, 'rgba(22, 23, 24, 0.35) 0px 10px 38px -10px, rgba(22, 23, 24, 0.2) 0px 10px 20px -15px'],
    },
  }}
/>

In this example, the Select Menu is implemented as a full screen Dialog.

</Box>

</Grid>

<Video id="uEyUbQ_eqwg" poster={amazonVideoPoster} />

The video above shows the how the screen reader lacks enough context and information to accurately announce the list
of options.

## The Select Primitive

Most of the Primitives available in Modulz are used in the Modulz app itself. The Select is a core component for us, it's widely used and users will interact with it hundreds, if not thousands, of times.

### Keyboard navigation

Implementing keyboard navigation is one of the most important accessibility features of the Select component. It helps users with motor diabilities navigate across the options in the select. Blind users also rely on keyboard for navigation. It's also important for other types of disablities, such as people with tremors, people without hands or people who have no use of their hands.

Keyboard navigation can also improve the user experience for people without disabilities, by allowing users to achieve their goal without reaching out for the mouse.

We support full keyboard accessibility so you can do anything you need without using your mouse.

When the Select Button is focused, you can:

- Press `Space` key to open the menu
- Press `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to open the menu
- Typeahead lookups

When the Select Menu is opened, you can:

- Press `Space` or `Enter` keys to select the highlighted item
- Press `Esc` to close the menu
- Press `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate across items
- Typeahead lookups

### Typeahead

You can rely on typeahead funtionality if you're focused on the Select Button or when the Select Menu is opened.

<ProductVideo small src={typeaheadClosed} />
<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>

</Text>

<ProductVideo small src={typeaheadOpen} />
<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>
  Typeahead when Select Menu is opened example
</Text>

Pressing the same letter will loop over all items that start with that letter.

<ProductVideo small src={typeaheadLoop} />
<Text as="legend" mb={7} sx={{ color: 'gray700', lineHeight: 0 }}>

</Text>

Loop through items starting with the same letter if that letter is pressed repeatedly

### Screen reader

We provide the right `aria-*` attributes according to the WAI-ARIA specification to ensure voice over works correctly.

### Positioning

When you open the menu, we'll make sure that it's properly positioned above the menu, whilst keeping the selected item placed on top.

### Collision

In the unlikely scenario where there's not enough space to position the menu relatively to the selected item, we'll adjust the positioning automatically.

### Scroll based height

If the menu needs scrolling, we'll automatically add Scroll Indicators where necessary. As you start scrolling the menu, we'll proportionally update the height to allow more items to be visible at once.

### Focus trap

When the Menu is opened, the focus is trapped to the Menu container. Pressing `tab` at this point will prevent the focused element to changing. To navigate across the Items, the up and down arrow must be used.

### Scroll lock

When the Menu is opened, the page cannot be scrolled.

### Block clicks outside

When the Menu is opened, clicks on elements outside of it will be blocked. When you click outside, the Menu will be closed.

### Styling

As showed in the demo above, all the parts (and their corresponding states) that make up a Select componment are available in the parts panel.

The Select Primitve consists of two main parts, these are the `Button` and the `Menu`. Each of these part contains furhter nested parts.
