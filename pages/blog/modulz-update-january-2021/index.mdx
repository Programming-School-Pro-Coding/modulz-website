Just before Christmas, we launched the latest Modulz release to our existing beta users. Today, we're inviting hundreds more from our waitlist, so check your email!

Since launching in December, we've released many exciting features.

## Redesigned property panel
Holding z and drawing will now zoom.

- Min/max dimension inputs have been collapsed into a Popover, to save space.
- Background image properties have been moved into the color tool.
- Auto Layout icons have been refined, and the gap property has been moved into the Dimensions panel.
- The Transform and Custom CSS panels have been collapsed initially.
