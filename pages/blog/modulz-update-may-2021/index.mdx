For this release, we focused on freeform layout and advanced style properties. And as usual, we've sent out hundreds of invites.

### Snapping
Freeform layout is much more fun with snapping.

### New Position panel
With the new Position panel, you can position objects relative to a parent. Handing for pinning your AppBar to the top of the viewport.

### Backdrop filter
Now you can apply filters to anything behind the object. Perfect for frosted glass effects.

### Redesigned spacing panel
You can now drag+drop, or paste images and SVGs directly onto the canvas.

### Wrap in auto layout
You can now copy/paste styles from one element to another. This is a powerful feature.

- Copy styles as regular CSS.
- Copy styles as CSS with object syntax.
- Copy the JSX tree of an element, or even an entire artboard.
