Building a custom Select is hard. Very hard.

There are many cases to consider. From accessibility concerns to collision-aware positioning. Unfortunately, because of this complexity, custom-built Select components fall short of the mark.

This article highlights the common pitfalls and demonstrates how we overcame these challenges while building our Select for Modulz.

Look closer at custom-built Select components around the web. Keyboard navigation. Typeahead functionality. Collision-aware positioning. Screen reader support. These are some of the most common features that custom Selects tend to lack.

Our goal was to retain as much of the Select's native functionality as possible while enabling completely custom styling.

Below is a list of all the features we've built into our Select, they all work out of-the-box, leaving only one task for you: make it look yours.

### Keyboard navigation

Keyboard navigation helps users with motor disabilities navigate across the options in the Select. Blind users also rely on keyboard for navigation. It's also important for other types of disablities, such as people with tremors or people who cannot use their hands.

Keyboard navigation also improves the user experience for people without disabilities. It allows them to achieve their goal without reaching out for the mouse.

Every Select designed with Modulz supports keyboard accessibility, out of the box. So you can do anything you need without using your mouse.

When you focus the Select, you can:

- Press `Space` key to open the Menu
- Press `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to open the Menu
- Typeahead lookups

When you open the Select Menu, you can:

- Press `Space` or `Enter` keys to select the highlighted item
- Press `Esc` to close the Menu
- Press `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate across items
- Typeahead lookups

### Typeahead

Typeahead is a technique for searching and filtering through text. It's also known as autocomplete. Our Select component uses it to
provide suggestions based on what you type.

Select components designed in Modulz include typeahead by default. Your users will be grateful.

You can rely on the typeahead functionality when you focus the Select or when you open it. In both cases, it works like this:

- Your keystrokes will be stored in a memory buffer
- After one second of inactivity, the buffer resets
- Pressing the same key will loop over suggestions starting with that character

### Screen reader

A screen reader is an assistive technology. It helps people who are severe visual impaired to use a computer.

Our Select component follows the WAI-ARIA authoring specification. This ensures it's accessible to screen reader users.

Every Select designed will Modulz works with screen readers. One less thing thing for you to worry about.

### Positioning

When you open the Select, the currently selected option will be placed above the button. In the unlikely scenario where there's not enough space (a collision), the position will be adjusted.

### Scroll Indicators

When the number of options exceeds the available Menu height, it becomes scrollable. To improve user experience, Scroll Indicators will appear where necessary.

### Scroll based height

When you scroll the Menu, we'll increase its height. This maximises the number of options visible at once. It helps users scan and find the option they're after.

### Focus trap

Focus trapping is an important accessibility feature, specially for screen reader users.

When you open the Select, the Menu gets focused. Pressing `Tab` will prevent elements outside of the Menu from receiving focus.

### Scroll lock

When you open the Select, the page can't be scrolled. This ensures the Menu is always in view.

### Block clicks outside

This functionality prevents clicks on elements that are outside of the Select component. When you click outside, the Menu will close.

### Styling

The Select component has many parts. In Modulz, you can style each part and their respective states.
