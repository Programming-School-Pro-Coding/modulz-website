The complexities of an accessible Tooltip can be easily overlooked. CSS only Tooltips are cool, but chances are, they'll lack some key accessibility features.

This article highlights the common pitfalls and demonstrates how we overcame these challenges while building our Tooltip for Modulz.

Tooltips are a core component for us since it's used often within the Modulz interface, so it had to be excellent.

Tooltips should appear as a result of hovering or focusing an element, but only after a small delay. If a tooltip is already visible, hovering or focusing another element that also displays a tooltip, should display it instantly.

The tooltip should disappear when the element is no longer being hovered or focused, when pressing the `Escape` key or when the user has interacted with the element, for example, a click on a button.

Tooltips are customizable, so if you want to choose which side it appears on, you'd use the `side` prop. If you want to choose how it's aligned, you'd use the `align` prop. If you want to hide the arrow, you'd use the `noArrow` prop.

In addition to all of the above, tooltips are aware of collisions. If a tooltip doesn't fit where it's supposed to, it'll automatically be adjusted to ensure it's visible for the users.

### Demo

<Flex sx={{bg: 'yellow400', p: 7, borderRadius: 2, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

<Tooltip label="Remove property" align="center">
  <IconButton>
    <TrashIcon />
  </IconButton>
</Tooltip>

<Tooltip label="Close popover" side="top" align="center">
  <IconButton ml={2}>
    <CrossIcon />
  </IconButton>
</Tooltip>

<Tooltip label="Reload window" align="center">
  <IconButton ml={2}>
    <ReloadIcon />
  </IconButton>
</Tooltip>

</Flex>
