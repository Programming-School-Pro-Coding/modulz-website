## What happens next?

Here's what happens when a new design system is created:

- You'll be taken to the [quick setup](/learn/quick-setup) screen
- It's named "Untitled system", you can change the name in the [design system settings screen](/learn/design-system-settings-screen)
- A [style guide](/learn/style-guide) is automatically created
