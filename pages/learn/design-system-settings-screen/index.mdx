## Update your design system settings

You can change your design system's name under the "Settings" section.

> **Note:** Your design system name will be used to generate the `Provider` Component. For example, a design system named `Wallop` will export a `WallopProvider` Component.

## Team

You can manage your members and their roles under the "Team" section.

> **Note**: Changes made here will impact your [organization members](/learn/manage-organization-members).

## Set your style guide URL

You can set your style guide subdomain under the "Style guide domain" section. For example, changing the subdomain to `wallop` will update your style guide URL to [https://wallop.modulz.app](https://wallop.modulz.app). This is on a first come first served basis.

## Delete your design system

If you wish to delete your design system, you can do so under the "danger zone" section. Clicking the delete button will prompt a dialog with an extra confirmation step.
