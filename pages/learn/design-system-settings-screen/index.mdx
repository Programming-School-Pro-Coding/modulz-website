## Update your design system settings

You can change your design system's name under the "Settings" section.

> **Note:** Your design system name will be used to generate the `Provider` Component. For example, a design system named `Wallop`, will export a `WallopProvider` Component.

## Delete your design system

If you wish to delete your design system, you can do so under the "danger zone" section. Clicking the delete button will prompt a dialog with an extra confirmation step.
