Organizations can have multiple members of different roles. In this article, we'll take a look at how to:

- Add a new member
- Change an existing member's role
- Remove a member from an organization

These features can be found on your [organization dashboard](/learn/organization-dashboard-screen), under a section called "People".

## Add a new member

You can add a new member to your organization by clicking on the "Invite" button. You'll be prompted to enter an email address and choose a role.

Here's a breakdown of each role:

- **Owner**: Can change organization settings, view billing, and send invites.
- **Admin**: Can send invites, but cannot change organization settings or view billing.
- **Member**: Can edit design systems, but cannot change settings or send invites.

## Change an existing member's role

Once a member has accepted their invite, you can still change their role by clicking on the <Icon><ChevronDownIcon/></Icon> next to the current role and picking the new desired role from the popover.

## Remove a member from an organization

Following the same steps as above, you can find the option to remove a member from the organization.
