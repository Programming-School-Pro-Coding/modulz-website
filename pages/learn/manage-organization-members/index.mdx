Organizations can have multiple members of different roles. In this article, we'll take a look at how to add a new member, change their role and remove them from an organization.

These features can be found on your [organization dashboard](/learn/organization-dashboard-screen), under a section called "People".

## Invite a member

You can add a new member to your organization by clicking on the "Invite" button. You'll be prompted to enter an email address and choose a role.

Here's a breakdown of each role:

- **Owner**: Can change organization settings, view billing, and send invites.
- **Admin**: Can send invites, but cannot change organization settings or view billing.
- **Member**: Can edit design systems, but cannot change settings or send invites.

## Manage a member

Once a member has accepted their invite, you can still manage their role or remove them from the organization.
