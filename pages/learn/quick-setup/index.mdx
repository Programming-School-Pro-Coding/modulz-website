## Customize your tokens

Customize tokens and scales such as color, space, type, and opacity.

## Style your first component

Customize your components states and variants to match your branding.

## Add integrations

Connect third-party apps to sync your published design system.

## Invite team members

Collaborate with your team by [inviting them to your organization](learn/manage-organization-members).
