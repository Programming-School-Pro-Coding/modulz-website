The user settings screen is where you can configure your personal information, password, organization and delete your account.
It can be accessed by clicking on your avatar located at the top right corner.

On this page, you can:

- Update your settings
- Change your password
- View your organizations
- Delete your account

## Update your settings

You can change your name, email, and avatar under the "personal settings" section. Your email is not displayed publicly and is only used for important purposes.

## Change your password

You can change your password under the "password" section. We recommend that you use a strong password for security reasons. We currently don't support 2FA, but it's on our radar.

## View your organizations

You can see all the organizations you belong to under the "organizations" section. Clicking on the avatar or the name will switch to that organization. Clicking on the <Icon><DotsVerticalIcon /></Icon> button will give you extra options.

## Delete your account

If you wish to delete your account, you can do so under the "danger zone" section. Clicking the delete button will prompt a dialog with an extra confirmation step.
